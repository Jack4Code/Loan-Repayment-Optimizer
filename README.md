# Loan-Repayment-Optimizer




The purpose of this project is to solve a problem in an overthinking-like way. The problem is this: 
 Let's say you have multiple loans you are repaying. These loans have different principal balances, interest rates, and amortizations. Now let's say that you have enough money each month to make more than the minimum payment on all the loans. How should you apply that extra monthly amount? Should you always apply it towards the loan with the highest interest rate? Should you take into consideration the principal? 
 Doing some simple mathematics or using excel can quickly answer this question. Or we can create a loan repayment optimizer!!! 
 My plan is to eventually build on top of this project and hopefully build a nice little application people can use to optimize their loan repayments...assuming the answer of course isn't that you always pay on the loan with the highest interest.
